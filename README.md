### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

- 💡 **Ideas must become reality:** I focus on creating robust, scalable, and easy-to-understand software, considering every detail from start to finish.

- 🛠️ **Limited resources, immediate action:** I've handled UI design, database setup, programming, and deployment in my projects when resources are scarce.

- 💻 **Passion for C# and .NET:** Since discovering C# and .NET, I see programming differently. These technologies simplify development and enhance software quality.

- ⏳ **Making the most of free time:** I use my free time to learn and deepen my knowledge through relevant platforms and official documentation.

- 📧 **Contact:** If you're interested, feel free to reach out at **danielbarros_dev@hotmail.com**.

- 🌐 **Portfolio:** Check out my work at **[danielbarrosdev.com](https://danielbarrosdev.com/)**, where I showcase my projects and efforts.
